Markup the Delete Button
Our code should now handle a delete. The next step is to change the HTML to pass in the ID. The ID must be passed in the <form> postback. This is triggered by a submit button in an <a> tag. A hidden <input> tag can be used to store the ID in the browser until the user clicks Delete and does the <form> postback.

One new Bootstrap trick:

btn btn-danger btn-sm - make a small red button
Instructions
1.
In Pages/Continents/Index.cshtml, change the <div> surrounding the Details and Edit buttons to a <form>. Add the attribute method="post".

Inspect the Index File
The Pages folder tree contains all of the Razor Pages (.cshtml) with their associated PageModel class files (.cs). Open the Index.cshtml page to see how Razor markup is used. Notice it starts with the directive @page followed by @model IndexModel. The rest of the page is a mix of C# code and HTML markup.

Our data project requires several new pages that will live under this folder.

Instructions
1.
The file Index.cshtml is open in the Pages folder. Look at some of the other cshtml files to see how the syntax works.

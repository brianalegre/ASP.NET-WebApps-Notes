Inspect the site.css File
Use the file manager to open the wwwroot folder. All static files are stored here. There are default folders for css (styles), js (front end JavaScript code), and lib (third party libraries). Open lib to see that jquery and bootstrap are available.

Data validation requires JavaScript files which are stored in the wwwroot/scripts area.
